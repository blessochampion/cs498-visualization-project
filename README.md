### About the Visualization

The chosen hybrid structure is an Interactive Slideshow. It consists of 2 slides where the reader has the ability to look at the full dataset as well as highlight data based on a categorical variable.

The visualization is based on a dataset from the Environment Protection Agency which contains horsepower, CO2 emission and vehicle type information of 4,411 vehicles manufactured in 2015.

### Scenes

There are two distinct scenes in the narrative visualization. They follow the same template and layout for visual consistency. 
- The project title is fixed in place above the visualization container for the duration of the narrative visualization.
- The visualization container which displays the data and is consistent with height 550px, width 980px, and background color "grey" for the duration of the narrative visualization.
- The plot axis and legend are consistent for the duration of the narrative visualization.
- The scenes were designed for consistency to keep the viewer from getting disoriented through transitions.

### Annotations

Annotations are used to highlight data and direct the user to further investigate the data. The annotations use a consistent template for font size and style which is <h4>.
- The annotation in Scene 1 is text positioned above the data inside the visualization container meant to highlight the primary finding of the visualization. "As Horsepower increases C02 Emissions increase for all vehicle types." When transitioning to Scene 2 the annotation for Scene 1 is cleared.
- The annotation in Scene 2 is text positioned near the user interface to highlight the possibility of user engagement with the data. If the user wishes to navigate back to Scene 1 the annotation for Scene 2 is cleared.

### Parameters

### Triggers

The essay properly discusses the triggers, including what user events trigger what parameter value changes, and how the viewer is aware of available user events.
